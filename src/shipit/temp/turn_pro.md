What mindset would you adopt? What habits would you cultivate?


As a pro, I would approach emotional labor with a sense of purpose and dedication. I would understand that this work is necessary for my growth and success, and I would commit to doing it to the best of my ability.

My mindset would be one of resilience and determination. I would view emotional labor as a challenge to be overcome, rather than a burden to be avoided. I would remind myself that this work is not always easy, but it is always worth it.

To cultivate the habits of a pro, I would prioritize self-care and self-awareness. I would make sure to take breaks and recharge when needed, but also be mindful of my emotions and how they may impact my work. I would also make a conscious effort to communicate effectively and set boundaries, both with myself and others, to ensure that I am not taking on more emotional labor than I can handle.

I would also strive to continuously improve and learn from my experiences. I would seek out feedback and reflect on my performance, making adjustments and learning from any mistakes. I would also surround myself with other professionals who are also committed to doing emotional labor, and learn from their approaches and strategies.

Overall, as a pro
