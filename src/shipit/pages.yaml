    What’s the project?
    (Make ‘the project’ manageable, finite, time-dated and do-able (or failable). Subprojects are fine.) If you can’t write it down, you don’t have a project.

    When does it ship?

    Please give a date and a time.

    Who is responsible for shipping it?

    You can list team members, but only one person is responsible. Put a * next to her name.

    Pick some edges

    No one cares about boring.

    We care about the extremes.

    When you make compromises before you ship (and you will), don’t compromise the edges that matter.

    Questions and ideas for the devil’s advocate (things to say to slow things down, average things out or create panic or malaise):

    It’s too soon

    It’s too late

    It’s technically risky

    It’s boring

    It will offend retailers

    There are significant legal issues

    The plant is too backed up to produce this

    It will take too much training to support

    The Media won’t get it

    Our industry is too regulated

    The home office won’t approve

    There’s no room in this year’s budget, let’s review in a few months

    It might fail

    Our big competitor will steal it

    It’s been done before

    It’s never been done before

    People will laugh at us

    If you hear any of these, underline them. If you find yourself saying them, stop yourself.

  smart_template: ShipItPageTemplate
  prompt: >
    Who becomes your competition?

    (One reason to hesitate is that shipping something opens you to criticism.

    Another, sneakier reason to hesitate is that shipping also opens you to competition,

    to people who will then try to overcome your lead, putting you into a race.

    So, who is about to compete with you?)

    The Bradman Test
    What would Donald Bradman, the best who ever lived, do if this were his project?

    (of course, this is a great reason to stall, because being the best who ever lived
    at what you do is an almost impossible standard. If you’re going to wait until
    that happens, you’re going to wait a long time, no?)

    But you’re not Bradman
    Since you’re not impossibly good at the core skill involved in this project, how will things be different? What will you bring to this project that someone who is truly gifted might not?

    Okay, let’s try again. Given that you’re not the Michelangelo of this domain, the Julia Child or even the William Shatner, how can you possibly hope to have a breakthrough? e only solution is to find edges others haven’t found, to bring a dynamic others are afraid of. What’s yours?

    Gated Thrashing
    Take the items on the previous page and force them into one of four categories, with as many as possible in the first two.
    First: before you start design and production
    During: while you’re working
    Testing
    Final
    The discipline of thrashing is to refuse to move onto the next step until each item is approved, in writing.

    Smart meetings checklist

    Would skipping this meeting impede our ability to ship? Could it be a wiki or Basecamp meeting instead?

    If we have to have the meeting, can we do it in a room with no chairs?

    Can we invite fewer people? How few?

    What’s the purpose of this meeting? Pick one of the following, and you can only pick one. If it’s more than one, skip the meeting.

    • Inform people about the project

    • Learn opinions or facts that will help you ship

    • Discuss the project and gain input from
    interested parties

    • Pitch or approve the idea

    After we’re finished, how will we know if the meeting was a success?

    Turn Pro

    Emotional labor is doing the work you don’t feel like doing, because that’s the work.

    emotional labor. If you were a pro at this, how would you do it differently?

  prompt: >
    e system we grew up with is a mess. It’s falling apart at the seams and a lot of people I care about (maybe you) are in pain because the things we thought would work, don’t. Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. ey have become victims, pawns in a senseless system that uses them up and undervalues them.

    It’s about a choice and it’s about your life. is choice doesn’t require you to quit your job, though it challenges you to rethink how you do your job. It’s time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map.

    Stop settling for what’s good enough and start creating art that matters. Stop asking what’s in it for you and start giving gifts that change people. en, and only then, will you have achieved your potential.

    For hundreds of years, the population has been seduced, scammed and brainwashed into fitting in, following instructions and exchanging a day’s work for a day’s pay. at era has come to an end, and just in time.

    You have brilliance in you, your contribution is valuable, and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must. I’m hoping you’ll stand up and choose to make a difference.
